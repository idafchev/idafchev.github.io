title:  "New Blog"

From now on I'll publish new posts on my new blog - [https://idafchev.github.io/blog](https://idafchev.github.io/blog)  

I wanted to change the theme for this blog, but there were some issues:  
  * The new theme I chose was using different URL paths for the blog posts. This meant that any references to my existing articles would break and I didn't want that.  
  * I didn't know how it would affect the current SEO. I have a couple popular pages and certainly didn't want them to disappear from the searches.  

Although there might've been a solution to all of this I didn't feel like spending the time to learn how to configure the same URLs or testing the SEO.  

I chose an easier solution just to create a new github project page called blog, which will use the new theme and mirror my content there.  

All my current posts are moved to the new blog and both blogs will remain active, but I'll publish new content only on the new one.
