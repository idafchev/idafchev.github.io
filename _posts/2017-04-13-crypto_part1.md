# Introduction
[I moved this article to my new blog. Click here to read it there.](https://idafchev.github.io/blog/crypto_part1/)  

In the Crypto series of posts I'll try to explain different encryption algorithms, implement them in code and then try to break them. They're also writeups for the [cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) crypto challenges and I recommend trying to solve them youtself before reading this and other crypto posts.

I'm not a cryptographer, nor  am I an expert in programming! The purpose of these posts (and the blog in general) is for me to write down what I've learned so it can be useful to others (and for others to point out my mistakes!).

# Single-byte XOR cipher
This cipher applies the XOR operation on every byte of the plaintext with the same one-byte key. For example:  
key = 'k' ; plaintext = 'plaintext' ; ciphertext = kkkkkkkkk XOR plaintext

![xor01](/images/crypto_xor/xor01.png)

And to decrypt the message XOR every byte of the ciphertext with the key:  
key = 'k' ; plaintext = kkkkkkkkk XOR ciphertext

![xor02](/images/crypto_xor/xor02.png)

Below is a function that does XOR of two strings of equal length:  

```python
def xor(str1, str2):
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        raise "XOR EXCEPTION: Strings are not of equal length!"
    s1 = bytearray(str1)
    s2 = bytearray(str2)
  
    result = bytearray()
    for i in range( len(s1) ):
        result.append( s1[i] ^ s2[i] )
    
    return str( result )
```

The function for encryption and decryption:  
```python
def single_byte_xor(plaintext, key):
    if len(key) != 1:
      raise "KEY LENGTH EXCEPTION: In single_byte_xor key must be 1 byte long!"
    return xor(plaintext, key*len(plaintext))
```

# Break the single-byte XOR cipher
This cipher is essentialy a substitution cipher, so it's vulnerable to frequency analysis and because the key is only one byte it's also easy to bruteforce (there are only 256 possible keys...).  
The frequency analysis is suitable for longer messages, so I'll implement only the bruteforce method which always works regardless of the message length.  

But when we try every one of the 256 possible keys, how do we know that the produced output is the actual plaintext? If the plaintext is written in english, we need a way to test if a given string is an english text.

To decide wether a string is an english text I'll use some the following rules:  
1. The string contains only ascii printable characters  
2. Letter 'E' and space are the most frequent characters (for sufficiently long messages)  
3. The letters E,T,A,O,I,N make up around 40% of the text (those are the most frequent letters in the english language) 
4. The digraphs cj, fq, gx, hx, jf, jq, jx, jz, qb, qc, qj, qk, qx, qz, sx, vf, vj, vq, vx, wx, xj, zx never occur in english words  
5. Punctuation makes up to 2%-3% of the text (for short messages up to 10%).  
6. Has at least one vowel (every word should have at least one vowel) 
7. Around 80%-90% or more of the text should be made up of letters

I found the digraphs using the following script and [this dictionary](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt) which contains 355k english words.    
```python
import string, itertools

f = open('words.txt','r')
file = f.read().lower()
f.close()
    
digraphs = []
for digraph in itertools.product(string.lowercase, repeat=2):
    d = ''.join(digraph)
    if file.count(d) == 0:
        digraphs.append(d)
            
print "Digraphs: ", digraphs
```

For the punctuation statistic similar script was used and a 1000 page ebook.  
```python
import string

f = open('book.txt','r')
file = f.read().lower()
f.close()
    
cnt = 0
for char in string.punctuation:
    cnt += file.count(char)
  
print "Punctuation makes up %f %% of the text!" % ( float(cnt)*100/len(file) )
```

And below is the code I wrote that checks if a given string is an english text, by using the rules mentioned above. It's not perfect but most of the time works well enough.  

```python
import string

def has_nonprintable_characters( text ):
    for char in text:
        if char not in string.printable:
            return True
    return False

def has_vowels( text ):
    vowels = list("eyuioa")
    for char in vowels:
        if char in text:
            return True
    return False

def has_forbidden_digraphs( text ):
    forbidden_digraphs = ['cj','fq','gx','hx','jf','jq','jx','jz','qb','qc','qj','qk','qx','qz','sx','vf','vj','vq','vx','wx','xj','zx']
    for digraph in forbidden_digraphs:
        if digraph in text:
            return True
    return False

def has_necessary_percentage_frequent_characters( text, p=38 ):
    most_frequent_characters = list("etaoin")
  
    cnt = 0
    for char in most_frequent_characters:
        cnt += text.count(char)
      
    percent_characters =  float(cnt)*100/len(text)
  
    # The most_frequent_characters shoud be more than 38% of the text.
    # For short messages this value may need to be lowered.
    if (percent_characters < p):
        return False
    return True
  
def has_necessary_percentage_punctuation( text, p=10 ):
    cnt = 0
    for char in string.punctuation:
        cnt += text.count(char)
  
    # Punctuation characters should be no more than 10% of the text.
    punctuation = float(cnt)*100/len(text)  
    if punctuation > 10:
        return False
    return True

def has_english_words( text ):
    most_frequent_words = ['the', 'and', 'have', 'that', 'for',
    'you', 'with', 'say', 'this', 'they', 'but', 'his', 'from',
    'that', 'not', "n't", 'she', 'what', 'their', 'can', 'who',
    'get', 'would', 'her', 'make', 'about', 'know', 'will',
    'one', 'time', 'there', 'year', 'think', 'when', 'which',
    'them', 'some', 'people', 'take', 'out', 'into','just', 'see',
    'him', 'your', 'come', 'could', 'now', 'than', 'like', 'other',
    'how', 'then', 'its', 'out', 'two', 'more ,these', 'want',
    'way', 'look', 'first', 'also', 'new', 'because', 'day',
    'more', 'use', 'man', 'find', 'here', 'thing', 'give', 'many']
  
    for word in most_frequent_words:
        if word in text:
            return True
    return False
  
  
def is_english( input_text ):    
    text = input_text.lower()
  
    if has_nonprintable_characters( text ):
        return False

    # If the text contains one of the most frequent english words
    # it is very likely that it's an english text  
    if has_english_words( text ):
        return True

    if not has_vowels( text ):
        return False
 
    if has_forbidden_digraphs( text ):
        return False

    if not has_necessary_percentage_frequent_characters( text ):
        return False

    if not has_necessary_percentage_punctuation( text ):
        return False
 
    return True
```

Now we are ready to construct the bruteforce function.

```python
def break_single_byte_xor( ciphertext ):
    keys = []
    plaintext = []
  
    for key in range(256):
        text = single_byte_xor( ciphertext , chr(key))
        if is_english( text ):
            keys.append( chr(key) )
            plaintext.append( text )
    
    # There might be more than one string that match the rules of the is_english function.
    # Return all those strings and their corresponding keys and inspect visually to 
    # determine which is the correct plaintext.
    return keys, plaintext
```

Lets test it!

```python
msg = 'This is a very secret message!'
key = '\x0f'
ciphertext = single_byte_xor(msg, key)

k, pt = break_single_byte_xor( ciphertext )  
print "Keys: ", k
print "Plaintexts: ", pt
```

The output is:  
Keys:  ['\x0f']  
Plaintexts:  ['This is a very secret message!']  

# Repeating-key XOR cipher
This cipher uses a key that is more than one byte long. The key is repeated until it matches the length of the message.  
For example: key='secret' ; plaintext = 'plaintext' ; ciphertext = secretsec XOR plaintext

![xor03](/images/crypto_xor/xor03.png)

Here is the implementation:  

```python
def repeating_key_xor(plaintext, key):
    if len(key) == 0 or len(key) > len(plaintext):
        raise "KEY LENGTH EXCEPTION!"
  
    ciphertext_bytes = bytearray()
    plaintext_bytes = bytearray(plaintext)
    key_bytes = bytearray(key)
  
    # XOR every byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte from the key  
    for i in range( len(plaintext) ):
        k = key_bytes[i % len(key)]
        c = plaintext_bytes[i] ^ k
        ciphertext_bytes.append(c)
      
    return str(ciphertext_bytes)
```

# Breaking the repeating-key XOR cipher
This one is trickier. There are mainly two steps here:
1. Find the key size
2. Crack the key

Finding the key size is done by the following algorithm:
1. Make a guess about the key length
2. Divide the ciphertext by blocks, each with length equal to the one chosen at step 1
3. Calculate the hamming distance between the first few blocks (I had best results with 4-5 blocks) and then take the average
4. Normalize the hamming distance by dividing it by the chosen key length
5. The key length that gives the smallest normalized hamming distance is PROBABLY the actual key length (if it's not, it is usually one of the three with the smallest normalized hamming distance)

Hamming distance is equal to the number of bits by which two strings of equal length differ. 
Take this two bytes:

00101010  
01000010

The hamming distance between them is 3, because they differ by three bits - the 4th, the 6th and the 7th (counting from the least significant).
Calculating the hamming distance is easy - just XOR the two strings/bytes and count the number of ones in the resuting string.

```python
def hamming_distance(str1, str2):
    result = xor(str1, str2)
  
    return bin( int( result.encode('hex'), 16) ).count('1')
```

To crack the key there are several steps:
1. Divide the ciphertext by blocks with equal length, same as the length of the key
2. Transpose the blocks. That is, make a new block from the first bytes of the blocks, then a second block containing the second bytes of the blocks and so on...
3. Each of the transposed blocks contains bytes that are encrypted with the same byte. That is the single-byte XOR cipher! And we already know how to break it.
4. Crack the single-byte key for each of the transposed blocks.
5. All bytes taken together produce the key 

Lets illustrate those steps:

![xor04](/images/crypto_xor/xor04.png)

By now I hope you see how this method works :)

Here is the function I wrote for finding the probable key length:

```python
def find_xor_keysize( ciphertext, hamming_blocks, minsize=2, maxsize=10 ):
    hamming_dict = {} # <keysize> : <hamming distance>
  
    if (hamming_blocks*maxsize) > len(ciphertext):
        raise "OUT OF BOUND EXCEPTION! Lower the hamming_blocks or the key maxsize!"
  
    for key_length in range(minsize, maxsize):
        # Take the first 'hamming_blocks' blocks
        # with size key_length bytes
        blocks = []
        for i in range(hamming_blocks):
            blocks.append( ciphertext[i*key_length : (i+1)*key_length] )
    
        # Calculate the hamming distance between the blocks
        # (first,second) ; (first,third) ; (first,fourth)
        # (second, third) ; (second, fourth)
        # (third, fourth) ; There are sum(1,hamming_blocks-1) combinations
        hd = [] # hamming distance
        for i in range( hamming_blocks - 1 ):
            for j in range( i+1, hamming_blocks ):
                hd.append( hamming_distance(blocks[i], blocks[j] ))

        hd_average = float(sum(hd))/len(hd)
        hd_normalized = hd_average/key_length

        hamming_dict[key_length] = hd_normalized
  
    # Get sorted (ascending order) list of tuples. Sorted by dictionary value (i.e. hamming distance)
    sorted_list_tuples = sorted(hamming_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
  
    # One of the three keys that produced the lowest hamming distance
    # is likely the actual size
    return [ sorted_list_tuples[0][0], sorted_list_tuples[1][0], sorted_list_tuples[2][0] ]
```

The cracking step turns out to be a little harder. The transposed blocks are every n-th character of the ciphertext
and so their corresponding plaintext isn't composed of english words. This makes it harder to distinguish which one-byte key produces
the correct plaintext. That's why it's necessary to have a long message (longer message -> longer blocks) to be able to use statistical methods on the transposed blocks.

![xor05](/images/crypto_xor/xor05.png)

1) I take every possible one-byte key for a single block and test if it produces ascii printable output. If it does, I store it in a list (that way I filter out may invalid keys). There is one such list for every block, which contains the keys that produce printable output.

block1: keys[a,b,c,d]  
block2: keys[1,2,3]  
block3: keys[w,x,y,z]  

2) Then I store all those lists in another list. This list now contains all possible one-byte keys for every block. 

list: [ [a,b,c,d], [1,2,3], [w,x,y,z] ]  

3) After that I generate all possible combinations of the collected single-byte keys (with key length as returned from find_xor_keysize) using that list.

a1w  
a1x  
a1y  
a1z  
a2w  
a2x  
and so on...  

4) Try every one of the produced multi-byte keys against the whole ciphertext, and test if the output is an english text.

ciphertext  
xor  
a1wa1wa1wa  
=  
output  

test if output is english text

        for j in range(num_blocks):
            # tmp is composed of the i-th character of every block

        print "Keys to try: ", len(real_keys)

                raw_input()
                print "=================="
```

Lets test it!

```python

And it worked! There were two possible keys for one of the blocks - ['0', '7']. If the message was shorter there would've beem 
many possible keys with thousands of combinations (or none).

As you can see, for some blocks there are many possible keys, and for others none were found.
