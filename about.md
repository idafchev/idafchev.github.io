Currently working as Security Researcher, focusing on threat research, malware analysis, developing static and behavioural anti-malware signatures for AV and EDR. My past experience is as Security Analyst where I was involved in incident response, digital forensics and security monitoring. Also performed penetration tests on occasion.

My interests are in blue team activities like malware analysis, digital forensics, threat research, although sometimes I also find interest in offensive research.

In my blog I write down the things I learn, because when you try to explain something you can see if you truly understand it. 

I greatly appreciate any feedback about the articles :)
