Just a guy interested in infosec. This blog is mainly to write down the things I learn, because when you try to explain something you can see if you truly understand it. 

Also I'm no expert, but most importantly I'm human, so I make mistakes. If you spot something that's wrong or have recommendations I'll greatly appreciate it if you tell me. To contact me, you can write a comment or use the contact page.
