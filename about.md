Just a guy interested in infosec. This blog is mainly to write down the things I learn, because when you try to explain something you can see if you truly understand it. Occasionally I might write about non-security related or even non-tech subjects that I'm interested in.

Also I'm no expert, so if you spot mistakes or have recommendations please tell me. To contact me, you can write a comment or use the contact form.
